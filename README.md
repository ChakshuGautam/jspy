# Python Interpreter Features

This file tracks the features that we want our Python interpreter to support. As each feature is implemented, we can mark it as complete by checking the box next to it.

## Language Features

- [x] Integer literals (e.g., "2")
- [x] Addition (e.g., "2 + 2")
- [x] Subtraction (e.g., "2 - 2")
- [x] Parentheses (e.g., "(2 + 2) - 2")
- [ ] Multiplication (e.g., "2 \* 2")
- [ ] Division (e.g., "2 / 2")
- [ ] Variable assignment (e.g., "x = 2")
- [ ] Variable reference (e.g., "x")
- [ ] Function definition (e.g., "def f(x): return x + 2")
- [ ] Function application (e.g., "f(2)")
- [ ] If statements (e.g., "if x > 2: return x else: return 2")
- [ ] While loops (e.g., "while x > 2: x = x - 1")

## Infrastructure Features

- [x] Tokenizer
- [x] Parser
- [x] Interpreter
- [ ] Error reporting (e.g., syntax errors, type errors)
- [x] Testing infrastructure

## [ ] Packaging
